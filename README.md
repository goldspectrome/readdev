ReadDev:  Mappings for Minecraft Infdev 20100630

ReadDev is an MCP based set of mappings for Infdev 20100630 for use with Enigma.  I originally intended to just make these and use these for myself, but I decided to release them.

All class files have been mapped to the best of my ability, there are about a dozen other classes that aren't fully mapped as I don't have a clue what they areand I couldn't find any modernized versions in b1.7.3 MCP (what I used as a mapping base).

HOW TO USE:
1. Go download Enigma Swing.  Any version 1.4.1-all or later should work just fine, I recommend using the -all variant.
2. Download ReadDev.  Either keep it as a .zip or extract it to a folder, whichever way you do it should work with how we're going to open it.
3. Download Infdev 20100630 from Omniarchive (skip this step if you already have it)
4. Open Enigma, select File.  Choose "Open Jar", you'll want to navigate to whereever your copy of Infdev is and then choose it.
5. In Enigma, select File again.  Choose "Open Mappings", and then select either Enigma ZIP or Enigma DIRECTORY depending on what you did with ReadDev during step 2, then navigate to whereever you placed ReadDev and open it.
6. Now select Decompiler.  I recommend using Procyon, so set it to that.
7. After selecting what decompiler you want, go to File one more time, and select "Export Source", then you'll be propted with where you want to put the deobfuscated code.  
8. If you did all the steps correctly, then you should have a deobfuscated source of Infdev 20100630.  Happy modding!
